## Rerquerimiento de la prueba


Hello! Welcome to the React coding challenge! We want to check your Reactjs knowledge by giving you an application to finish. Your goal is to finish this application and make the application usable.
Instructions
The app is a ricky and morty viewer, this API allows developers to access information such as characters, episodes, locations, and more. The API also offers the ability to search and filter the data by different criteria.
You have to implement almost the entire views (characters, episodes and locations).
Your goal is to list and paginate all views, which are the endpoints of the rick and morty documentation. Also, you have to build a login saving the credentials on the web app. 
Feel free to use any design library such as bootstrap or tailwind css, the look and feeling of the app also increase your challenge points.
You should also take note of the linter and prettier, at the end of the challenge create a repository and send the link to my email or whatsapp and the credentials to enter the app.

Requirements:
*Last version of react.
*React hooks.
*Log in and Log out.
*State Manager.
*Don’t use the Rick library.
*Save favorites on local storage.
